/**
 * Gate: `docs/index.md` is a complete, resolvable index of the repository's docs.
 *
 * The index is the progressive-disclosure entry point: `AGENTS.md` carries
 * standing orders and links here, and this table is what sends a reader to the
 * one document — and the one section — that owns a subject. A hand-maintained
 * table like that rots in two directions, and this gate closes both:
 *
 *   - A row can point somewhere that no longer exists. Every row's home file is
 *     checked on disk and every entry-point anchor is computed from the target
 *     document's headings, so a renamed heading fails here rather than silently
 *     dropping a reader at the top of a page.
 *   - A document can be added and never indexed, which makes it unreachable
 *     through the documented path. Every Markdown file under `docs/` and the two
 *     root entry points must appear as a row's home.
 *
 * The table shape is enforced because the gate has to read it: one topic, one
 * backticked home path, and exactly one entry-point link per row.
